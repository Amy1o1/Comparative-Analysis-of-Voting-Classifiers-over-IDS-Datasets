# Comparative-Analysis-of-Voting-Classifiers-over-IDS-Datasets
The project at hand generates an interface that allows the user to select one of three IDS datasets to use for building Ensemble models. The interface offers six Classification algorithms and allows the user to create an ensemble using a combination of any or all six of the models. The model built by the user can then be analyzed independently and be compared to the previous ensemble models made as well. All the data in terms of performance i.e., the performance metrics are being stored in csv files for further exploration.
